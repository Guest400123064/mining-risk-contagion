"As we have always said, the revised Kumtor investment agreement signed in 2009 is a solid agreement and through constructive dialog were committed to seeking a mutually beneficial resolution that is fair and in the interests of all Centerra shareholders, with a view to ensuring the continued success of Kumtor.",0
This also reflects our disciplined approach to treasury management and capital allocation together with our commitment at all times to act in the interest of all shareholders as we had outlined earlier.,0

The South African underground operations improved markedly over the first quarter.,0
Where we'll likely see a little bit of pickup or further reduction in the per ton cost would be on the processing and then on the G&A side.,0

"Sequentially, however, improved productivity resulted in lower cost as total segment adjusted EBITDA expense fell by $2.59  per ton.",0
"Full year gold production was 73,000 ounces, an increase of around 12% on financial year 2011.",0
"And then shaft capacity, as you know, is beyond the $4 million but we will have about 1 million tonnes of waste coming up there.",0

"2014, we'll need to move less mining.",0
"With these and other growth opportunities at each of our assets, we are well positioned to deliver on our strategy.",0

"So the question was about the fact that in Slide #5, it shows that during the second quarter and the current quarter, the coking coal prices were lower than the anthracite and the brown coal prices.",0
"On the M&A side, we think that consolidation continues to happen in the Illinois Basin because gas has become more of a competitor, which I think will force more consolidation in the coal industry.",0
"At the end of August, the territory held elections and a new government was elected.",0
Our go-hard approach to cash preservation in the face of the volatility and uncertainty that we've seen this year continues to be an appropriate measure as is our prudent approach to releasing some of those initial savings back into the business but focused on our additional growth opportunities.,0
And this is the advantage that coking coal and coke group has.,0
"We have the highest productivity in the world in Garpenberg and in Aitik, we have the AGM today at Garpenberg.",0
Our sales increased by 47.3% in total.,0

"So production almost doubled to 196,000 ounces.",0
"So there's potential that there's some production coming starting in 2023 from that zone specifically, but it won't be a very high production.",0
Its been a profitable mine.,0
A couple other things to mention in the cash flow statement.,0
"All-in sustaining costs for Q1 were 2% or $19 an ounce lower year-on-year at $1009 an ounce, and that was on the back of lower cash costs and sustaining capital.",0
"If you don't present the plan or the plan is not good enough, then you have to demolish the -- totally or partially, the tailings dam wall.",0

The net loss included approximately $14 million spent on exploration.,0
"In terms of continuing to bring down cost, however, I mean, we've also set very aggressive targets, as we indicated, for 2015 and '16, which we're going to -- and that's our -- the philosophy you'll see from us going forward.",0
We're doing all the things you need to do to restart.,0

2011 would be 7 million in the 55 million ton scenario and 8 million in the 60 million ton scenario.,0
And thank you for joining us for Teck's Second Quarter 2014 Investor Conference Call.,0
"So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board, and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting, we're really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation is going well, make sure we've got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye on shareholder returns, as you saw with the dividend, that we believe we're positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline.",0
"We take into account the provision of our collective bargaining agreement, which, I guess, the reference point, the average industry results.",0
And they have submitted their affidavit as well as replied to certain committee that they believe that they should be given the rein.,0
"And as I said, we will far exceed our previous indicated $500 million figure, but we'll give further details on that on the 10th of September.",0
"We have contracted out almost 1.25x of our requirement so that if situation arises and the demand is there, we can increase our production immediately.",0
It's keeping us all on our toes and we see a lot of upside across the board.,0
"We are working on exploration and stuff, so we don't know in all the details, but in the plan, we have next low year by then.",0
"In his new role, Brian will help Newmont stay at the forefront of sustainability and stakeholder alignment on a global basis.",0
"We're still dealing with a lot of pressure, so we're in the process of overcoming those with the completion of the Davy Jones and the Blackbeard area and Lineham Creek later this year or early next year, but Lomond is the first well that we drilled where we see excellent reservoir characteristics, consistent with porosities in the 20% range that are more aligned with what we see in Miocene-type reservoirs and Pliocene-type reservoirs that have excellent flow capabilities and excellent production rates.",0
"The tonnes we're taking out, the objective of the exercise, obviously, is not to keep forcing that incremental plan into the market and trying to avoid the effect that has on the rest of our portfolio.",0
"If you look at the milling option requires an EIS, an environmental impact statement, and probably, in our opinion, the largest permitting issue or the permitting issue that's critical path is water.",0
"The volume of the mining in 2015 is scheduled to be around 3.5 million, 3.8 million tonnes.",0
"All this makes for interesting times in our industry, an industry where there are 57 reactors under construction, the majority of which will be online over the next several years and 14 or 15 of which are expected to start up this year.",0
"As we move on through 2008 (sic) [ 2018 ], we expect these numbers to be much more firmer.",0
And then to try to drive a net [ph] neutral goal.,0
"Operator, I will turn the call back over to you.",0
"It's -- if you like, we get paid for the mining services first and then whether it's with the industry we'll be reducing the ownership in those mines over time.",0
"Meanwhile, we are currently advancing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo north area.",0
"Hence, total loss of the group, $95 million in the first half 2014.",0
"But so far, no mighty impact yet.",0
"So the team has done a really good job optimizing that asset, generating free cash flow.",0
"Sales volume relative to Sudbury increased by 84% to 12,300 ounces of gold due to a combination of increased production and positive changes in gold ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton.",0
"But if you look at the performance in the next chart, as we've swung from a high-grade highly profitable open cut operation, we've had to deal with the loss of 600,000-ounce open cut operation.",0
"But we export principally, roughly about 750,000 or 1 million tons out of the East from our Coal-Mac operation off API-2.",0
"In particular, though, coal inventories at PRB-served plants at September 30 were estimated to be at 54-day supply, below the five-year average and the lowest day supply in the country.",0
"On just about every financial metric, 2009 was our best year ever at Pan American.",0
"And quite a bit of equity towards Tenke Fungurume, and to see cash starting to come back from this in the fourth quarter is a big deal to us, and will help contribute to Lundin's growth.",0
We turned out an EBITDA of $507 million for the year.,0
"But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and steadfast in protecting people.",0
And we are really preparing now ourselves for the final phase of the review.,0
"We have had a good copper output from the Maurliden East pit, which we are depleting in the coming quarters.",0
So everybody's oriented to try to beat plans.,0
Significant increase in mine rates take advantage of the resources that we have.,0
"Dean will talk about some of the exploration advances there, which could extend the mine life.",0
"In this quarter, we've had increasing prices.",0
"As I take over as CEO from the 1st of April, my priorities are to a drive operational excellence, improve business performance across the different assets, to focus on enhancing Vedanta and Sesa Sterlite brands, which include several aspects, such as safety, CSR, communications, et cetera.",0
"And the stimulus as I mentioned to some other people earlier today, I mean, you got $25,000 from the government.",0
"In the meantime, turning to the next slide, you can see the continued importance of our refreshed exploration efforts with an $80 million budget committed for '22.",0
We think those are going to start inching up a little bit.,0
I'll just add to that.,0
"So in that sense, it can't be extended any further.",0
"Group refined production, including salable production from Impala Canada was, therefore, 5% lower.",0
"Only essential frontline personnel are on the priority list to return to site, and our support areas are working remotely off-site.",0
"And there was a long geotechnical explanation that my guys were talking to me about, long and complicated.",0
"But quarter 4, going forward, should be positive cash, as always, has been our trend.",0
Those who follow the company can see that we have removed Kumtor from our 2021 and 3-year outlook production and cost guidance.,0
"We've seen the rest of the mining industry, how the results were affected round about 40% downswing.",0
So we expect that spread will narrow as some seek to exploit that difference.,0
"Now rest assured and regardless of the need, when we continue -- we will continue to remain disciplined, and if we don't see good value, we're quite happy to stay patient and apply our cash flow to further building of the balance sheet and paying of the dividend.",0
"If you look at the press release that we put out last week, you see there are some more narrow, very high grade silver veins.",0
"And with that shift to a new phase of growth for Teck, it is important to shareholders, in particular, that the strategy is owned and led by the CEO, who will be around and accountable for it in the longer term and I clearly wasn't going to be the one to be around.",0
Mike has dealt with the special dividends...,0
"I think the balance -- well, the balance will come out to the $300 million across that 5 years, is what it should calculate out to ending in 2018.",0
But we recognize production prior to the cobalt rounds actually being delivered to our warehouse.,0
"Richard, I think it's important when we talk about the target production levels when we go underground, the event sort of occurred since Grasberg deposit and we are able to continue to look at the underground ore body that we expanded the group of 75 up to almost 0.5 billion of MLC.",0
"And we see, within our set of assets, the ability to continue that going forward.",0
"Other than the snow storms in the West, we've not had any rail delivery impacts at all.",0
"Consistent with what we have seen over recent years, the first half of 2022 featured a series of global supply disruptions, which created a tight market and price spike, particularly in Q1.",0
The operation remains on track to deliver its originally provided copper production and cash cost guidance.,0
"Notably at Jabal, exploration has been very promising, and we have intersected very high-grade mineralization from step-out drilling that point to mine life extensions.",0
"It means the incline and decline system below [ remains ], it sits very close to the UG2 and therefore, you've got some wet ground to get to the [ Marikana's ] main whole process.",0
"We have premier operating assets, a proven track record of execution, and we are enhancing profitability at our operations.",0
"If you then compare that to our peers, the top 5, they operate somewhere between 33% and 46%.",0
"ASEAN imports also rose compared to the prior year, driven by ongoing urbanization and general economic growth.",0
We recorded record ore tonnes being mined.,0
That's been the primary contributor to that swing this year.,0
"So if you look at silver, we'd be well under $800 an ounce place during the quarter.",0
And Suralco is about halfway point of going through the remediation.,0
"So in capex, we probably see more inflation or the risk of greater inflation than in opex because we're exposed to both the monetary side of inflation, in other words, the price of individual inputs going up.",0
There's no denying market conditions remained depressed.,0
"This quarter does wrap up the majority of advisors fees, legals and things of that nature associated with the merger.",0
Thank you for your interest.,0
"At site, there is not 1 procedure that has not been affected by COVID-19.",0
"And at current spot rates, the project's IRR is even more attractive at about 25%.",0
We met or exceeded our most recent production guidance for all metals.,0
And we did it more quickly than we originally said.,0
"Operator, we would like to open the lines for calls, please.",0
"We never wanted to be more specific in that in terms of how we execute this program, because it is a situation that's driven by the marketplace and our cash evaluation.",0
And I will ask colleagues from the Management Board to present these aspects.,0
We have no hedge positions at this point.,0
"Yes, let me jump in here, Holly, and Paul can add whatever he sees fit.",0
"So they are trying to relax permitting issues, create more pipelines, etc., more drilling permits.",0
"Hey David, this is Brett here.",0
"During 2019, our consolidated production was 174,400 gold equivalent ounces, approximately equal to our production last year, and total sales were 175,500 ounces.",0
We have our annual Investor Analyst Day coming up November 6.,0
"$1,350, in our view, is the right number.",0
"I mean, the size of each of the projects are more -- they suits more our size, our financial capacity, our resource capacity.",0
"Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions.",0
"We are again revising down our cost estimates in Australia, with Australian cost per ton now targeted to be $53 to $56, nearly 20% below 2014 levels.",0
"This mainly results from the mining progressing into the deeper levels of the Adamus pit, and during the last quarter, accessing some of the areas that had very good grade in the pit.",0
And $4 million higher G&A between the sites and corporate.,0
And that wiped out a large part of the tonnage we had and the resources.,0
"So we've got a few drill rigs underground now, which we're actively drilling.",0
"The second phase of the project is also advancing well, with procurement of all major equipment complete and on track to reach 24,000 tonnes per day by mid-2023.",0
"In the case of the assets that we're now incorporating into Brio Gold, Fazenda Brasiliero, Pilar and C1 Santa Luz.",0
We did a lot of sill development in 2019.,0
"To the left, we see the copper side, basically, seasonality or a result of the very strong Q4.",0
"Certainly, the zones at Penon, it's a matter of scheduling.",0
But behind the macro story are very divergent markets between the Pacific and the U.S. Atlantic regions.,0
"All-in sustaining costs were $1,245 per ounce, compared to $1,081 per ounce for the year ended December 2016.",0
We will continue with the deployment of our improvement process that focuses on safety and cash generation.,0
So what I wanted to leave you with was that our focus on free cash flow is not just on costs.,0
"So thanks, guys, for the work you've done and in particular, thank you for making the time to come and talk to us.",0
"And let me remind you again that we hit our capital numbers 4 years running, after 50% blowouts in 2008.",0
"And we do expect it to get better over 2014, but it's not going to happen overnight.",0
"In Indonesia, the underground reserves there that are available to us represent what appears to be the most profitable, exciting copper mine development project in the world.",0
"And in that regard, today, we've announced that we intend to divest our nonoperated interest in Bass Strait.",0
"We run parallel columns of just the ore - just agglomerated ore and then we add the tailings to the different column and we - what we do is we call twins, and the one with the tails of the gravity mill have higher recoveries than the other one.",0
"This cash flow increase is inclusive of over 3x more nonsustaining exploration spend, which is in line with our strategy of unlocking exploration value.",0
And so you can make some assumptions about what our uranium prices will be for the balance of the year.,0
And you can see the volatility of this.,0
"And yes, like I said, that should be pretty even over the 4 quarters.",0
"So the total dividend is ZAR 12 per share, including the ZAR 5 interim dividend we've paid.",0
"With 5.85 million ounces of proven and probable reserves, Vista controls the third largest reserve package in Australia.",0
"In November and December of 2010 alone, the Mechel Group procured about 400 of gondola or box cars, rail cars, and therefore its own prop fleet which is handled by the logistic segment of the Group currently makes up some 5,500 of rail cars.",0
"But I think, to your point, the -- particularly the quality of the investment cases, understanding the risks and making sure these things meet our hurdle rates is where a lot of the time and effort is going into on this team.",0
The mine is going a bit deeper.,0
The increase in sale was an effect of beneficiation of low-grade iron ore procured.,0
Our team is continuously engaged with the state and central government with support of the people who are adversely impacted by the suspension for the earlier resumption of mining in Goa.,0
"We understand, as I said, they're in a pickle and we want to be there to work with them to provide more production from the United States of America and other developed countries that are allies, not our folks.",0
The industry -- the gold industry can't control the securities industry.,0
"This enabled us to capitalize on the strong copper price and, together with better-than-expected recovered grades from the historical gold stockpiles at Prominent Hill, resulted in net revenue of just under $1 billion for the half.",0
"At our Uranium businesses, earnings were impacted by lower grades at ERA.",0
Seaborne metallurgical coal quarterly settlements declined some 30% over the past year.,0
We said we would produce between 330 million and 340 million tonnes.,0
"So, you got a price of $285 FOB, and you have a project in Argentina which is going to require at least $600 FOB mine to justify.",0
So we're not seeing any constraints being put in place by the government.,0
"Looking further, breaking down the marketing in the industrial part of the assets, as I said earlier, the marketing adjusted EBIT is up 6%, up to $1.2 billion.",0
"And we'll have a bit more color on that likely in February, as we complete our ore reserves and resource calculation and have a better sense of the likely mix of underground and open pit ore as we start that mine at some point in 2016.",0
"With Lynn Branch coming online, the met qualities from our Bandmill complex will change drastically and favorably.",0
So we don't intend to run them down.,0
"The balance of growth at GRE46 was achieved by moving to a higher gold price assumption of AUD 2,000 per ounce, enabling optimization of our MSO outlines to cut-off grade of 1.5 grams per tonne.",0
"We also have a skill set that has proven its ability over time, to identify opportunities to add incremental value to the business, and also, to put together and execute on a plan to be able to deliver that value.",0
"All-in sustaining costs is a relatively new metric, which continues to evolve, but we think it reflects the real cash costs required to produce an ounce of gold.",0
Our cash costs increase was contained at 1% despite inflation and stronger currencies on the back of the additional 7% increase in ounces produced.,0
"So the additional production from either Toquepala's expansion and Buenavista expansion, comes at a lower cost than coolant [ph] production at both sites.",0
So we're on track to achieve the $1 billion.,0
Safety is a core value at Rio.,0
And we're very confident that we can get our assets up to a higher utilization rate.,0
"Besides this, we are considering also the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is a very interesting project for us.",0
"So if we continue to generate the cash flow that we've been generating and the gold price stays where it is, I wouldn't be surprised if we come up with a higher dividend going forward.",0
So things are advancing a long term quite well on the project.,0
"So we expect a little over 8 grams, we're getting a little over 12 grams.",0
"So looking over to the balance sheet, net debt is expected to go down by the year-end, as I said, in both terms.",0
Moving on to our projects.,0
"Market reception was strong, with roughly $1.1 billion in demand, allowing us to expand our bank group, price the new $700 million revolver at an attractive 165 basis point initial drawn spread and replace the old term loan with a new $250 million term loan.",0
"We're in a stronger position than we were last year, both with precipitation and advancement of those projects.",0
