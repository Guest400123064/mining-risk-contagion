"The budget also includes $18.3 million for San Carlos, with approximately half allocated towards underground development and the remainder allocated towards the pre-strip of the open-pit portion of the deposit and construction of the bridge across the Mulatos River.",0,keep
And bulk of that contributor has been the VAT lockups and the cash loss in terms of South Africa.,0,keep
Our coal business is very exciting with robust fundamentals and market prices and are increasing production for just a nominal amount of capital per ton of increased production.,0,keep
"On the production side of things, the company produced 122,000 gold equivalent ounces, which was above our revised guidance of 115,000 to 120,000 gold equivalent ounces.",0,keep
And we're at the point now where we will start to build more of that higher grade into our forward plans.,0,keep
"I think important thing to point out is that our cash cost per recoverable ounce placed during the quarter -- so that is cash costs, which are our mining costs, our processing costs and our G&A site costs per recoverable ounce placed was only $565 an ounce.",0,keep
"To the right, we see the zinc, which is an effect of, basically, Tara.",0,keep
"And then beyond that, we have historical leach stacks and conceivably using this technology to replace concentrated investments with some of our sulfide ore bodies.",0,keep
And we're projecting the average return over variable cost per acre of corn to be at record levels.,0,keep
The non-GAAP reconciliations of these amounts are included in our 2016 second quarter earnings release available on our website.Now let me discuss our results for the second quarter.,0,keep

25 kilometers of resource drilling was completed on top of 46 kilometers of exploration drilling.,0,keep
"And so in this organization, how we organize work and our determination as staff to make sure this is where we have an impact.If we mentioned that we're working very well with the commercial department as well as our cokers, we're all working hand-in-hand and that we're reacting quickly, then we can say that we're able to achieve good results.",0,keep
And we don't have a regional layer in between to deal with things and to buffer.,0,keep
"Our share price during this period, January '16 to present, delivered a gain of greater than 3x the S&P and 2x the Dow and better than 100% gain in 22 months.",0,keep
And now we've executed $1 billion range in the third quarter where we raised capital at higher than market prices.,0,keep
"If you look at anything in Northern Chile, Southern Peru, you're going to have to factor in that you're, most likely, if you're going to take a project to production, you're going to have to look at desalination.",0,keep
"And as a result, the outlook of new global gold production is now declining.",0,keep
"In terms of sales, we haven't had any problems with our customers.",0,keep
We'll need about 600 beyond the finishing of the pit mining for reclamation effort for a number of years.,0,keep

"At Zafranal, a feasibility study has been completed, and we have now received confirmation of our SEIA admissibility in Q1 2022.",0,keep
So it's not clear whether trucking cost would be higher than the reduction in processing costs.,0,keep
"And certainly, we've -- we're looking forward to next year and continue the drilling.",0,keep
"So we still look like we're okay, with fuel running West Texas sort of about $95 or so.",0,keep
"And the other expenditures are to ensure for our KGHM that we have the flexibility in our Victoria project contracts, and that is why we have embarked on investment projects.",0,keep
"And for Suralco, there is more money to be spent as we go through the remediation process.",0,keep

"In short, Tasiast is making great progress in becoming a large, low-cost producer.",0,keep
"In rutile, there's a significant portion which goes into welding and rutile is the best product for most of the welding applications.",0,keep
"The financial services portfolio is a diverse collection of investments in listed investment companies, funds management and financial advice companies.",0,keep
"We remain well positioned both operationally and financially to deliver on our strategy of operating, upgrading and growing a base metals portfolio that provides leading returns for our shareholders throughout the cycle.",0,keep
"No, we're actually doing the engineering studies of those 2 alternatives at the moment.",0,keep
"But as I said, this situation might get better, and we feel that we're well positioned also in the nickel market.When you add all this up together, you can see that our market term, what you see in this slide here, is that it went down pretty sharply over the summer.",0,keep
We have assets in copper.,0,keep
We went out the year with about 1.4 million tonnes of inventory.,0,keep
"And for reserve calculations or reserve purposes, we've retained the reserves as part of our -- in our reserve statement, and they haven't been reclassified.",0,keep
"Copper prices and zinc prices were much better supported, and as a result, our adjusted profit came in at about $1 billion or $1.74 per share.Overall, revenue was down approximately 9% to $9.4 billion, primarily, again, due to lower prices.",0,keep
We did not have any significant mark-to-market changes to the value of our equity holdings during the quarter.,0,keep
"In particular, we are going to see the same curve, where it's very evident that it was a sort of a jump, which came back to a very general positive sort of trend line, which started before Trump.",0,keep
"We've got at least until the end of Q1, where we've got lots of scope in terms of volume.",0,keep

"We are $3.47 for the second quarter, and $3.34 for the third quarter.",0,keep
"At Olympic Dam, our recently completed maintenance campaign has raised baseline production rates.",0,keep

"Yes, it's, for sure, a combination that a lot of improvements and the cost savings that you saw during the year and a lot of discoveries.",0,keep
We're pulling in these Gil satellites.,0,keep
"They all wanted to buy about 100%, and we'd be left with no continuing interest in the property.",0,keep
"Phase 3 of the project will continue as planned to the end of the year, in particular the KMS Shaft.",0,keep
Two Rivers is in the process of ramping up.,0,keep
"And their quantum of $30-plus million came from them, deriving a figure from 2011 onwards, which is when the mine started production.",0,keep
So we have a [ swack ] of drilling to do of the infill drilling.,0,keep
"In Q1, we expected to be 17,000 to 18,000 ounces at $625 to $650 an ounce.",0,keep
"For example, at Sunrise Dam, we had more than a 100-year flood event across that part of Western Australia.",0,keep
"So we will keep you up to date as part of our management reporting because the financial numbers will not be part of our overall report.With respect to domestic operations, we published the resource report for the first time for the entire KGHM Group according to the Canadian standard.",0,keep
"To ensure we are focused on mining higher-margin, lower-cost ounces, we launched a rigorous mine plan optimization program as part of the Kinross Way Forward, which applied a fully loaded costing methodology to all of our operating sites.",0,keep
"What we didn't do when we did the early forecast back in 2008, our planning process weren't robust enough to pick those up.",0,keep
"In mid-2013, the company successfully implemented a series of cost control measures, capital project cuts and refocused exploration programs to higher reward targets.For consolidated, all-in sustaining cash costs net of by-products for 2013 was $20.40 per silver ounce, in line with revised guidance issued for the year.",0,keep
We had increased exploration expense.,0,keep
"And as we've developed the access to the ore bodies and expanded those, that gives us a lot of flexibility to deal with operating issues that may come up with particular sections of the mine where we're mining.",0,keep
"Just to be clear, we don't lose the silver, it simply circulates back to the leach pad until it can be removed by Merrill-Crowe processing.",0,keep
Regional natural gas prices continue to trade at a discount to quoted Henry Hub prices and currently range from $2.25 to about $2.90 per million BTU.,0,keep

"Unfavorable policies, demonstrated by recent shifts towards protectionism, undermine confidence and disrupt trade.",0,keep
And our current 2- to 3-year focused investment program for additional drilling and ore reserve development will help preserve these gains and provide a stable ore reserve base for the company.,0,keep
"And most of that was [indiscernible] which is on the very high-grade silver concentrate, and obviously, the precious metals are the ones where we've seen the biggest price declines.",0,keep
"We also announced today that our Board has reinstated an annual cash dividend on our common of $0.60 per share that would be $0.15 per quarter.Now, Id like to turn the call over to Richard, who will refer to the slide material.",0,keep
"So with this, we will continue maintain -- to maintain our cash balancing in the region of $2 billion; and the debt level, in the -- in this similar level as today, with a 0.3x, 0.4x net debt/EBITDA as a ratio.",0,keep
"And then, of course, we also have a diesel tax that's in, I think, about SEK 100 million per year, right, which will be impacted by this.",0,keep
"The second item worth highlighting is the shift in our CapEx away from development capital to sustaining capital and the impact on our all-in sustaining cost, which we have spoken about on previous earnings calls.",0,keep

"So you may have a bigger footprint, bigger processing facilities.",0,keep
What's important in the R&R is the near-mine and the grade.,0,keep
Only 75% of the capacity is online right now.,0,keep
"Following the successful 2019, which saw 60,000 meters drilled, we expect to drill the same amount, 60,000 meters, at Zinkgruvan this year as part of our $15 million exploration program.On Slide 14, as previously mentioned, 2019 CapEx of $665 million on a cash basis was modestly below our most recent guidance of $695 million.",0,keep
"In the meantime, we are listening to and responding to inquiries from the communities near the Escobal property.",0,keep
"Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different than those expressed by or implied by such forward-looking statements.",0,keep
"We're certainly more diversified than we've ever been and with a number of development stage assets that are currently being developed, we expect to asset this diversification and significantly increase our cash flow over the next few years.Lastly, I thought I'd speak to our available cash and debt capacity.",0,keep
"Under the stream agreement, there is a lag of 1 quarter for silver deliveries from the Cerro Moro mine.For example, the attributable ounces in the third quarter is based on the mine's production in Q2.",0,keep
"You can see we got some limited help from prices and exchange rates in '18, but the most significant contributor to our performance was our own effort.",0,keep
"During the first quarter of 2012, all cash flow metrics were strong as follows.",0,keep

"In copper, we have seen the benchmark TCs going up to the level as we indicated or said in the previous quarter, and the spot terms are low, and if anything, a little indication of an improvement but basically stable.",0,keep
"We've already specced out some of the agitators, nuts, that sort of thing, gearboxes, but we want to be very sure as we move toward it, that we're matching up with future designs.",0,keep

"Next year, where we have some much more copper production, that number should decrease to 1 33.",0,keep
We're continuing to have high water issues in the Illinois Basin in particular with the rains continuing in that area.,0,keep
Then we paid some of our financing fees to complete the $350 million financing that we did in July.,0,keep

"Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.",0,keep
"So they're all things of high importance and consideration, but I wouldn't say that any one of them is a kind of locked in stand in terms of determining the right and prudent time to commence dividends at some level.",0,keep
"It's very pleasing to talk about the results for the second quarter, strong results out in the operations as we continue to deliver on our commitments to the market and to our employees and the rest of our stakeholders.",0,keep
"During the quarter, LME copper prices were above the average price of the copper hedges the company had in place.",0,keep
"The increase in operating profit is expected to be partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily due to higher employee-related costs.At our Minerals Management segment, we expect full-year operating profit and segment EBITDA to decrease moderately from 2020, excluding the impact of $7.3 million of impairment charges taken last year and an income -- and any income related to asset acquisitions made after March 31, 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ], including the ones J.C. discussed.",0,keep
And nearly 90% of consumption occurring in countries that have little to no primary production.,0,keep
"We've always been under the protection of court orders, court injunctions, court stay of execution.",0,keep
"For the gold segment, the revenues from silver sales are accredited to costs.",0,keep

You'll see on Slide 19 that our liquidity position was nearly $1.4 billion on June 30.,0,keep
"And of course, we used a quite significant discount rate.",0,keep
The Long Island life of mine [indiscernible] optionality.,0,keep
So we're basically 50% hedged for diesel and HFO needs for the next 12 months and then 25% for the subsequent 12 months.,0,keep
I want to leave you with the impression that we have a portfolio of assets that we are constantly looking at on whether we should be developing or taking other actions.,0,keep
"So when you look at the Wood Mac figures, for instance, they're forecasting that seaborne exports this year will be down 30 million tonnes.",0,keep
"So I think there will be a little bit of cost pressure, but I think compared to where we would have been if this occurred a year ago, we're in pretty good shape.",0,keep
"There's a net interest paid of $100 million arising from the repurchase of these bonds.From the 1st of January, 2019, there are changes to accounting standards, including the treatment of leasing arrangements.",0,keep
"We did some modest expansions of our 2 phosphate facilities in the U.S. And we -- of course, we're not buying imported rock anymore for Redwater.",0,keep

"You will see on the balance sheet a receivable of $22.6 million related to that sale, and we will collect that receivable just after the first of the year when the carbon is finally processed and will collect the receivable at that point in time.Our silver sales were 177,000 ounces as compared to 112,000 ounces from third quarter a year ago.",0,keep
Balance sheet's doubled in size over the last 5 years and will continue to do so in coming years.,0,keep
"But if you allude to Morococha and higher copper production, I'm sure you remember for the last few years actually, we have been very successful mining those small deposits with small ore bodies with copper in it which was, obviously, of great help.",0,keep
"Similarly, moving to the key milestones for 2021, where once again, all milestones remain the same as what we have shared in our Q2 call.",0,keep
"With respect to the lag that you're seeing in realized prices versus posted benchmark prices, given the sort of rapid run-up in potash prices in really all of the major markets over the course of the last several months and that lag is to be expected.",0,keep
"There's only 2 assets that are still waiting for permits, and that's expected very near term.",0,keep
"The preliminary numbers would indicate that surface operations have much less impact than some of the deep, gassy, underground mines.",0,keep
"It's really a function of when we find a resource, but between when we discover something and/or complete a PEA and get a permit, you're looking at a couple of years for each one of these, a minimum time frame to permit it.",0,keep
Our overall performance for the first half of the year has been strong and we continue to be on track to meet our company-wide guidance for the year.I'll now turn the call over to Paul Tomory for a review of our projects and exploration highlights.,0,keep
We do quite like the royalty company model and we do think about whether our royalty could be used as a growth vehicle in similar fashion to what youve seen others do internationally if not so commonly in Australia.,0,keep

"Looking ahead, all low-grade stockpiles are expected to continue to supplement new feed, while mining focuses on waste capitalization.",0,keep

"The first quarter was particularly difficult as we reached the [ far rim ] of the Bolivar West zone, our reduced ore zone within Mina de Fierro.",0,keep

"Prices and terms are positive, and that's already explained by the currencies.",1,noise
"The news release announcing our financial and operational results was issued yesterday after market close and is available on our website, tasekomines.com.",1,noise
I think the real issue.,1,noise
I will unpack the cost detail in a little while.,1,noise
"On this slide, you can see the column chart that illustrates the reserves at year end last 5 years.",1,noise
"But in the long run, we think that's a good thing, that they're managing their economy quite well.",1,noise
I think the second half is much cleaner than the first half.,1,noise
"Well, we hope to have better recoveries.",1,noise
Some extent of this will be done with arc systems.,1,noise
"I think, quite clearly, it still represents a good opportunity and quite clearly, we continue to look at all opportunities.",1,noise
I think the answer is somewhere in between.,1,noise
"Again, this is a very, very large operation with a very, very long life.",1,noise
So I think it starts with the Modikwa question.,1,noise
Those we will record as we get those tax credits.,1,noise
We need to take a hard look at all of our mines and ask the tough questions about what we need to do to operate differently in different price environments.,1,noise
I misspoke on our CapEx guidance.,1,noise
"Edlain, when you look at that proclamation, I've heard that too, and I'm like, ""But wait a minute, China is a bigger market than India.",1,noise

That will be over the next several months as we work through that process.,1,noise
And we have been looking at that RC drilling.,1,noise
"We provided a breakdown of the price variance by commodity at the back of your handout, in which you'll see that by far, the largest benefit came from the strong iron ore markets we've been enjoying.",1,noise
"Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone.",1,noise
We're literally one quarter into getting this letter.,1,noise
"Zinkgruvan, a pretty remarkable mine ahead of its -- a very strong fourth quarter to cap off its 160th year of continuous operation last year.",1,noise
"We look forward to receiving additional questions and clarification requests by e-mail or by phone, either to senior management or to IR team.",1,noise
It's where it is and is it available and what's the thinking going forward.,1,noise
So we haven't got a substantial lift of Rustenburg.,1,noise
"With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Russell.",1,noise
But we always have to be thinking ahead.,1,noise
This presentation is being webcast live and will be available for replay this afternoon.,1,noise
"Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining me on our call today.",1,noise
"Don't know exactly the number, probably around 7.",1,noise
"Yes, Chinese demand for the first and second half, was that what you were asking for, Chris?",1,noise
Look forward to the completion of the project and the addition to earnings and cash flow that we expect it to generate.,1,noise
"That would be for you, Dan.",1,noise
"This Q&A call is intended to provide participants with the opportunity to ask questions related to the third quarter results.I would like to note that this Q&A call may contain forward-looking information that is based on the company's current expectations, estimates and beliefs.",1,noise
"So as you'll recall, there's a hanging wall and a footwall limb of that folded unit.",1,noise
"And the point I raised was, we can do better, there's no doubt.",1,noise
Whether the coal will lose its [indiscernible].,1,noise
"So with that, thank you for joining the call today, and we'll speak again with you in early November to discuss our third quarter results.",1,noise

I'd say they're in the $13 range.,1,noise
I'll ask Guy if you want to talk about the resource rent tax.,1,noise
This information is updated regularly.,1,noise
So I think that's the right way to think about it.,1,noise
"These things take some time, and so we expect to continue to carry on.",1,noise
"So far, price are still into our range.",1,noise
It may be in the fossil fuel area.,1,noise
Just a couple of things.,1,noise
"Thank you and good day, everyone.",1,noise
We've got some other areas that are pluses and minuses.,1,noise
We continue to work on additional studies.,1,noise

"Chuck, perhaps you can explain how much of that is at San Francisco.",1,noise
Next question from the phone.,1,noise
Our financial results were issued yesterday after market closed and are available on our website at tasekomines.com.,1,noise

"We -- in a better market, and I joke with Grant that I was around to see enrichment technology move from gaseous to fusion to centrifuge.",1,noise
"And then, the first quarter, yes, is now a bit weak, all right?",1,noise
"We'd like to open up the lines, if you could, and take questions.",1,noise
"And from our point of view, is about delivery of long-term value for us.",1,noise
"Our forecast are based on what we know today about our projects, and they are unescalated.",1,noise
"But at this stage...Paul, Gerard here.",1,noise
But I'm really proud of what the guys have done up there.,1,noise
"So that was a very, very detailed exercise.",1,noise
And that's what we're going to do.,1,noise
And as usual -- and Mike will be doing all the interviews.,1,noise
"Operator, we'll like to open up the call for questions, please.",1,noise
"So it's something that we take a look at, Dave, but I -- any substantial tons, I guess, is what you're getting at.",1,noise
We're not saying that there's any misses.,1,noise
"And you can see on the bottom left, ex Africa has been very stable.",1,noise
And we will be publishing the correct table when we release our MD&A as part of our audited financials.,1,noise
So one final thought on how you should think about silver.,1,noise
Recovery levels are consistent with the grades.,1,noise
It's a shame that we're showing a share price that we're showing.,1,noise
I look over the shoulder.,1,noise
"Thank you very much, operator, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us.",1,noise
"This team have been incredibly efficient, and they'll get better as we go forward.",1,noise
"If the question is will the increased result, would that open up for new expansion programs?",1,noise
We just don't have that available capacity to ramp up even further.,1,noise
So you're referring to the appetite by other companies in the industry to use stream and royalty financing as an alternative?,1,noise
So you'll see those flow into this bucket.,1,noise
Each of these areas relies on the other to ensure the overall success of our business.,1,noise
"Thank you so much, and I thank you -- I thank the moderator, for organizing this conference.",1,noise
The next slide is utilized internally in my group to create a competition within my management team and the peers in the industry.,1,noise
"Thank you very much for coming, and we'll see you all again in 3 months.",1,noise
And thats really good bang for the buck.,1,noise
