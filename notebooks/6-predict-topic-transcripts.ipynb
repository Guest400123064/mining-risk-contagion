      "[ 0.93 ] As part of Kitchen Collection's program to realign its business, the company has taken additional steps to reduce expenses through a number of cost reduction programs implemented during the first quarter of 2014 at its headquarters, distribution centers and remaining core stores and by terminating its medical benefit plan in late February 2014.\n",
      "[ 0.93 ] We've commenced construction of the new heap leach pad, which is now approximately 20% complete.\n",

      "[ 0.91 ] In particular, the company continues to move forward to obtain a permit for its Otter Creek reserve in North Dakota in preparation for construction of a new mine.\n",

      "[ 0.89 ] On Slide 7, we continue to present our all-in sustaining margin both in dollars, ounces and on a per-ounce basis.\n",
      "[ 0.88 ] We've done a fairly good job, though, of displacing some of that export with some domestic sales that we jumped on earlier in the year.\n",
      "[ 0.88 ] Longer term, Hamilton Beach will work to take advantage of the potential to improve return on sales through economies of scale derived from market growth and a focus on its 5 strategic growth initiatives, all of which are outlined in overview in the earnings release.\n",

      "[ 0.84 ] I think we have enough inside programs right now to -- for the foreseeable future, but we will be coming back to everybody with our plans in next June for the sort of excess capital that we might have at that point in time and how that aligns with our growth initiatives.\n",

      "[ 0.83 ] Now for 2020, according to our strategy, what we want to do is to maintain the level of 450 from mines and 400 -- 540 of the electrolytic copper.\n",
      "[ 0.82 ] While we are proud of the portfolio growth in terms of total numbers, we are even more pleased with the quality of assets that we have added over the last year, such as royalties at the Andacollo mine, additional royalty interest at Barrick's Pascua-Lama project and Vale's Voisey's Bay mine.\n",
      "[ 0.82 ] With the acquisition of International Royalty Corporation and the Andacollo transaction, we expanded our number of producing and development royalties by 60% and grew our total royalty portfolio from 118 to 189 properties.\n",
      "[ 0.82 ] I would have to run our long-range plan, which will be probably another 3 months before we can work all of that in.\n",
      "[ 0.81 ] We're moving Quebradona along as well through feasibility study.\n",
      "[ 0.80 ] Norman's going through an exercise at Kumba at the moment, probably another 3 to 4 months in getting the logic and the planning right, and then another 6 months to roll that through the whole organization.\n",

      "[ 0.78 ] As we try to manage that -- those supply chains, and we do a lot of that today.\n",
      "[ 0.77 ] We're also making great progress at the Bald Mountain Vantage Complex project, which is also on schedule and on budget.\n",
      "[ 0.75 ] And we have already distributed quite a bit of the cash flow this year and you would have noticed that we have done some share repurchases so far and -- but they are, in addition, a number of different opportunities for investment in the business, as Mayo has mentioned, in the diversification of retail, where we continue to have a very robust pipeline in Brazil.\n",
      "[ 0.75 ] In the near term, Kitchen Collection expects to add stores cautiously and focus its growth on its core Kitchen Collection stores with new stores expected to be located in sound positions in strong outlet malls.\n",
      "[ 0.74 ] And as I said in my remarks, we are pricing -- we are selling them with multiyear deals.\n",
      "[ 0.73 ] And for us, we take kind of an inside-out approach, meaning we start by looking around our existing mines, what can we do at our mines, around our existing mines, in terms of incremental capital, incremental expansions or extensions to really leverage all of that big sunk capital that's gone into these 5 mines that we operate.\n",
      "[ 0.72 ] And what we have done is built a global purchasing platform, so with multiple suppliers.\n",
      "[ 0.71 ] During the year, our expenditures also reflected a significant amount of corporate development expenditures in connection with the acquisition of Beadell Resources, and we continue to incur cost related to the acquisition as we work through the closing of the transaction.\n",

      "[ 0.70 ] Looking forward, North American Coal continues to expect improved operating performance overall at its coal mining operations in 2014.\n",
      "[ 0.69 ] We need to open up some of these higher-grade areas, which are going to be happening over the next few months.\n",

      "[ 0.13 ] And to add the costs automatically track the volumes, so it should come down significantly with this volume pickup in Q4.\n",
